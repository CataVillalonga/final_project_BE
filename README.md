Here is CIKC Reloaded storeâ€™s backend.
For our backend we used the following technologies:
Javascript
Express
MongoDB
NodeJS
GIT

Following are the steps you need to follow in order to run our backend:

1. create a .env file and add a PORT param that will take the port number you want your project to run
2. create another param in the .env file with the mongoURL you want to use.
3. run npm i
